# Inch-by-inch-FrontEnd
This Repo is the Front-end of my Capstone project. For this project, I will be coding the Front and Back-End to an application of my choice. I will be using Angular and bootstrap to build my FrontEnd. [Repo for the BackEnd](https://github.com/Cecilierenee/Inch-by-inch-BE)

## Purpose
After doing the “Big Chop”, it didn’t take me long to realize; that it was going to be a long, strategic and possibly expensive process to find the products that work with my hair. To simplify this process, I’m creating an app to keep track of the various products and hair routines I follow.

## MVP
Users will be able to create a hair routine, where they can add, delete, and edit their list.

## The Process 

### Day 4 :sweat_smile:
  -User Login and registration errors<br>
  -Began working on Front End wireframe

## Day 5 :trollface:
  -Front end is coming together<br>
  -Still having issues with authorization, decided to scrap it.<br>
  -Hurdle: Going to broad, and maybe challenging myself too much

### Day 6 :rage:
  -Was trying to make a sepreate component for me navigation and my frontend ended up a complete mess.<br>
  -Hurdle REFACOTRING CODE THE NIGHT BEFORE! 

## Learning Points
  - Got my database to work<br>
  - Worked with bootstrap<br>
  - form validation in my Angular code<br>
  - Got endpoints to test properly<br>
