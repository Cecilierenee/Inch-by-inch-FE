# Inch-by-inch-FrontEnd
This Repo is the Front-end of my Capstone project. For this project, I will be coding the Front and Back-End to an application of my choice. I will be using Angular and bootstrap to build my FrontEnd. [Repo for the BackEnd](https://github.com/Cecilierenee/Inch-by-inch-BE)

## Purpose
After doing the “Big Chop”, it didn’t take me long to realize; that it was going to be a long, strategic and possibly expensive process to find the products that work with my hair. To simplify this process, I’m creating an app to keep track of the various products and hair routines I follow.

## MVP
Users will be able to create a hair routine, where they can add, delete, and edit their list.

## The Process 

### Day 4 :sweat_smile:
  -User Login and registration errors<br>
  -Began working on Front End wireframe

### Day 5 :trollface:
  -Front end is coming together<br>
  -Still having issues with authorization, decided to scrap it.<br>
  -Hurdle: Going to broad, and maybe challenging myself too much

### Day 6 :rage:
  -Was trying to make a sepreate component for me navigation and my frontend ended up a complete mess.<br>
  -Hurdle REFACOTRING CODE THE NIGHT BEFORE! 

## Learning Points
  - Got my database to work<br>
  - Worked with bootstrap<br>
  - form validation in my Angular code<br>
  - Got endpoints to test properly<br>

### Beyond The BootCamp :rainbow:

*02/05/2022*

Today Marks the day after the Java bootcamp I had the pleasure to participate in over the past 12 weeks. And while I worked very hard on my capstone project, I'm still left obsessing over the functionality of my web application. I find myself with a bit of an empty schedule at the moment, so to fill that void, I will keep my skills sharp by completing my application and documenting the process.

A few things I would like to focus on at the moment;<br>
  -Completing the functionality of my app (add, edit and delete funtions)<br>
  -Working with Bootstrp and my Css to ensure my app looks great!<br>
  -Unit testing<br>
  -Deplyoment<br>
  
  ## The Process
  
  ### Day 8 :sun_with_face:
  -Adding my delete, and update funtionality.<br>
  -Getting my form to post new routines
