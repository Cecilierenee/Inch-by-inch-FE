This Repo is the Front-end of my Capstone project. For this project, I will be coding the Front and Back-End to an application of my choice. 

## Purpose
After doing the “Big Chop”, it didn’t take me long to realize; that it was going to be a long, strategic and possibly expensive process to find the products that work with my hair. To simplify this process, I’m creating an app to keep track of the various products and hair routines I follow.

## MVP
Users will be able to create a hair routine, where they can add, delete, and edit their list.

## User Stories;
  -A user can create categories for their hair routines<br>
  -A user can edit categories for their hair routines<br>
  -A user can delete categories from their hair routines<br>
  -A user can create a new routine<br>
  -A user can add products to their routine.<br>
  -A user can edit the products in their routine<br>
  -A user can delete products from their routine.<br>
